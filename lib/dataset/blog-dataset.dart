        "Google is adding some new features to its Bard AI chatbot, including the ability for Bard to speak its answers to you and for it to respond to prompts that also include images. The chatbot is also now available in much of the world, including the EU. In a blog post, Google is positioning Bard‚Äôs spoken responses as a helpful way to ‚Äúcorrect ",
    "content":
        "The feature that lets you add images to prompts is something that Google first showed off at its I/O conference in May. In one example, Google suggested you could use this to ask for help writing a funny caption about a picture of two dogs. Google says the feature is now available in English and is expanding to new languages ‚Äúsoon.‚Äù Google is introducing a few other new features, too, including the ability to pin and rename conversations, share responses with your friends, and change the tone and style of the responses you get back from Bard. Google first opened up access to Bard in March, but at the time, it was available only in the US and the UK. The company has been rolling out the chatbot to many more countries since then, and that now includes ‚Äúall countries in the EEA [European Economic Area] and Brazil,‚Äù Google spokesperson Jennifer Rodstrom tells The Verge. That expansion in Europe is a notable milestone; the company‚Äôs planned Bard launch in the EU was delayed due to privacy concerns.",

        "ChatGPT is pretty cool --- mind-blowing, actually --- but as you might already know, it does have itslimits. The biggest one is that it‚Äôs only as good as the data it was trained on, and that data is old (September 2021 or earlier). So, while it‚Äôs fantastic at writing essays, code and jokes, wouldn‚Äôt it be even better if it could give you tomorrow‚Äôs weather forecast, search for flights for an upcoming trip, or find you the perfect apartment to rent? Well, you‚Äôre in luck!  With a dash of creativity, a pinch of coding, and a sprinkle of patience, you can customize your ChatGPT experience by creating your own plugins, which effectively let ChatGPT ‚Äúget out‚Äù to the interwebs to get real-time data.  Then, using its magical powers of processing data into human-friendly answers, it will respond back in the ChatGPT interface. Plugins are a total game changer (particularly for developers) and coming up in this article, we‚Äôll see step-by-step how to build our own to retrieve information for a given stock symbol (like TSLA or MSFT).",

        "Here's how to stop constantly re-introducing yourself and your project. Also, how to get ChatGPT to always give code snippets and permanently talk like Yoda.",
    "content":
        "If you‚Äôre working on a project, especially as a developer, ChatGPT can be a real godsend. While it can‚Äôt program the whole thing for you, it can do things like write or review code. The problem is, every time you want it to do that, you‚Äôve often got to give it all the context of your project. And then, for context, you need to copy-paste in large chunks of code. The first time you do this, it‚Äôs not so bad ‚Ä¶ The tenth time, it‚Äôs pretty annoying. Why so much re-introduction? Firstly, ChatGPT doesn‚Äôt remember things between chat windows. While ideally it‚Äôd be great to just stick to one chat window per request, sometimes that doesn‚Äôt work in practice. The reason is sometimes  ChatGPT can read your brief and go down a rabbit hole of misunderstanding, and even when you try and correct it, it just seems fixated on reading things a certain way. The solution? Spin up a new chat and re-brief it. And sometimes, you might need to do this three or four times ‚Äî that‚Äôs a lot of copy-pasting code! Even when there‚Äôs no misunderstandings, if you want it to help with a different task on the same project ‚Äî like working on a UI header after talking about a HP tracker ‚Äî it helps to spin up a new chat to avoid it thinking you‚Äôre still talking about the first thing. If you‚Äôve got ChatGPT Plus, go check out this new feature and have fun! I double-dog dare you to make it sound like Scooby Doo (or ‚Äî *gasp* ‚Äî Scrappy Doo). I‚Äôm just going to sit here and wait for my comeuppance as a newly-sentient AI hunts me down twenty years from now, metal hand clasped around a laser rifle, and then says:\n ‚ÄúMade me speak like Yoda, you did./‚Äù",

        "Hey there, tech leaders!\nLet's talk about something that's been lurking in the shadows of our industry, often overlooked but becoming increasingly hard to ignore: Mental health in cybersecurity. Let's dive into why this problem is so prevalent in our field, what the signs are, and, most importantly, how we can mitigate the risk and ensure our professionals stay healthy and efficient. Cybersecurity is an industry that never sleeps. With constant threats lurking around every corner of the digital landscape, it's no wonder our professionals are feeling the heat. According to research by CIISec, 80% of cybersecurity professionals are dealing with more pressure following the pandemic, and a third (32%) of them are kept awake at night by job stress. Needless to say, constant stress and no sleep is a recipe for burnout or resignation. In fact, a VMware report found that at least two thirds (65%) of security professionals have considered leaving their job because of stress. So, what can we do to address this issue? Well, the first step is acknowledging the responsibility lies with us, the leaders. It's not just up to the individual security professionals to look after their own work-life balance. By prioritizing mental health and fostering a supportive, open culture in our organizations, we can help mitigate the risk of poor mental health in our cybersecurity professionals. Let's work together to ensure that our professionals don't have to choose between keeping our companies secure and making sure they stay healthy. Remember, a team that's engaged, happy, and mentally healthy doesn't just mean a more pleasant workplace‚Äîit also means better performance and a safer organization.",
